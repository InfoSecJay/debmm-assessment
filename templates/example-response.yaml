    evidence: ""
    confidence: medium

  # --- Tier 1: Basic ---

    evidence: "We deploy manually from Git. CI/CD is on the roadmap for Q3."
    confidence: high
  T1-Q5:
    answer: 3
    evidence: "Rules are in Git with documentation. We're adopting DaC but don't have CI/CD yet."
    confidence: medium
  T1-Q6:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "We check critical data sources weekly but don't have comprehensive coverage mapping."
    confidence: medium
  T1-Q7:
    answer: "We monitor our top 10 critical data sources (EDR, firewall, cloud trail, AD logs) with basic health checks - mainly checking for data freshness and volume anomalies. We don't have formal telemetry coverage mapping against our detection rules. We know we have gaps in cloud telemetry but haven't quantified them."
    evidence: ""
    confidence: medium
  T1-Q8:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "We review threat landscape bi-annually when planning quarterly priorities."

    evidence: "Manual testing on critical rules only. No automated testing."
    confidence: medium

  # --- Tier 2: Intermediate ---
  T2-Q1:
    answer: false
    evidence: "We track alert volume but not FP rates per rule."
    confidence: high
  T2-Q2:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "We tune rules when analysts report excessive noise but don't track systematically."
    confidence: medium
  T2-Q3:
    answer: "We tune detection rules reactively when analysts flag high-noise rules in our Slack channel. We reduced alert volume by roughly 15% last quarter by tuning our top 10 noisiest rules. We don't have per-rule FP tracking or a formal tuning cadence. The team lead reviews tuning requests weekly."
    evidence: ""
    confidence: medium
  T2-Q4:
    answer: false
    evidence: "We know we have gaps but haven't done a formal ATT&CK-based gap analysis."
    confidence: high
  T2-Q5:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "Gaps are identified after incidents or when an analyst notices something missing."
    confidence: medium
  T2-Q6:
    answer: "Gap identification is informal. When we have an incident and discover we missed something, we add it to the backlog. We did an informal review against ATT&CK last year and identified about 20 high-priority gaps, but we haven't formalized this process or created a regular cadence."
    evidence: ""
    confidence: medium
  T2-Q7:
    answer: false

    answer: false
    evidence: "We don't have a formal FN triage process."
    confidence: high
  T3-Q2:
    answer: 1
    evidence: "We only discover missed detections during incident investigation."
    confidence: high
  T3-Q3:
    answer: "We don't have a formal false negative identification process. When we investigate incidents, we sometimes discover that our rules should have fired but didn't, and we fix them on a case-by-case basis. We haven't measured our detection trigger rate."
    evidence: ""
    confidence: high
  T3-Q4:
    answer: true
    evidence: "We have an annual pentest but it's not focused on detection validation."
    confidence: medium
  T3-Q5:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "Annual pentest includes some detection assessment but it's not the focus."
    confidence: medium
  T3-Q6:
    answer: 2
    evidence: "We have a few behavioral detections for PowerShell abuse and LOLBin usage."
    confidence: medium
  T3-Q7:
    answer: "We have 3 detections targeting advanced techniques: encoded PowerShell command detection, suspicious LOLBin usage patterns, and a basic anomaly rule for unusual parent-child process relationships. These were developed after specific incidents. We don't have systematic coverage of advanced TTPs."

  # --- Tier 4: Expert ---

    answer: false
    evidence: "Our detection engineer does occasional ad hoc hunting but it's not a formal program."
    confidence: high
  T4-Q2:
    answer: 1
    evidence: "No formal hunting program. Occasional ad hoc hunting by the detection engineer."
    confidence: high
  T4-Q3:
    answer: "Our detection engineer occasionally hunts through EDR and SIEM data when there's a new threat advisory or after reading interesting threat research. This happens maybe once a month and findings are shared in team meetings. There's no formal hunting program, hypothesis tracking, or systematic integration of findings into detection rules."
    evidence: ""
    confidence: high
  T4-Q4:
    answer: 1
    evidence: "Almost everything is manual. We have a few bash scripts for deployment."

  T4-Q5:
    answer: false
    evidence: "We haven't started using AI/LLM tools for detection work."
    confidence: high
  T4-Q6:
    answer: "We have a small set of bash scripts that help with rule deployment and basic formatting checks. All other processes are manual including rule development, testing, tuning, and documentation. We haven't explored AI/LLM tools for detection engineering yet but are interested."

    confidence: high
  EP-Q6:
    answer: true
    evidence: "Detection engineering has a budget line under the SOC budget."
    confidence: high
  EP-Q7:
    answer: "Our CISO is aware of and supportive of the detection engineering function. We have a dedicated budget line for tooling and one FTE. The security director receives quarterly updates on detection coverage and alert metrics. However, detection engineering metrics aren't reported to the executive team beyond the CISO."
